# Strings it
AUTHOR: SANJAY C/DANNY TUNITIS

Description
Can you find the flag in file without running it?
# Solution: 
Download the file and enter strings command. Creatively if you wanna save time use `strings filename | grep picoCTF`
Alternatively if you're too lazy just ctrl+f it in a text editor<br>
