Description
We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. Can you find the password of the user cultiris and successfully decrypt it?
Download the leak here.
The first user in usernames.txt corresponds to the first password in passwords.txt. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.

# Solution
Download both the files and open them in an editor. Check for the user `cultiris` and find out the pwd using line number. Now use ROT13 to decipher the text.
